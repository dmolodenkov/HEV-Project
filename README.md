# HEV-Project

Rule-Based Energy Management System Design for a Parallel Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) in MATLAB/Simulink. 
The main idea is to reduce the fuel consumption of a PHEV compared to a conventional implementation of the same model. 
Basic requirements were also considered, such as charge stability and compliance with component constraints (torques, charges). 
As a result, a reduction in fuel consumption is achieved: 19.3% and 26.4% for NEDC and FTP-75, respectively. See „Report.pdf“ for more information.

Default model:		    QSS_TB\Model\qss_hybrid_electric_vehicle_template.mdl
Developed model:	    QSS_TB\Model\qss_hybrid_electric_vehicle_new.mdl
Developed controller:	QSS_TB\Functions\controller.m

Detailed instructions how to work with QSS toolbox are contained in the Readme file in QSS_TB folder.
